# Window-Managers-MyConfigs
My personal configs for all Window Managers I used.

# Sway
Config file is a copy of /etc/sway/config.
You can also paste it in the /home/username/.config/sway/config and it should work. 
But I like to fly high speed low drag lmao.

# Hyprland
Config files in Hyprland are a little complicated. 
It is a modified version of,
<url>https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots</url>
Download this and replace my github files in /home/username/.config/hypr/ and /home/username/.config/waybar/

# Fin things you need to do to make this work

xrandr --output "DVI-D-0" --primary (Wayland equivalent for creating a primary display. This helps games like dota not take weird resolutions when running.)
